/**
 * @file heat-transfer.c
 * Solves the nonlinear heat conduction equation. 
 * \f[
 * \rho C_p\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \nabla\cdot\left(k\nabla T\right)
 * \f]
 * Density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity are all temperature-
 * dependent and are calculated using the Choi-Okos equations. Because density
 * is changing, but mass remains constant, there is a certain degree of
 * shrinkage/expansion that occurs during heating. This is calculated from the
 * deformation gradient as follows:
 * \f[
 * \underline{\underline{F}}(\underline{X}, t) = \frac{\rho(0)}{\rho(t)}
 * \f]
 * The updated nodal values are calculated at each time step using this tensor
 * and the mesh velocity is incorporated into the FEM equations.
 *
 * Finite Element Formulation (Global Coordinates):
 * \f[
 * R^i = \int_0^L \left\{
 *      \rho C_p \frac{\partial T_i}{\partial t}\phi_i\phi_j
 *      + T_i \frac{\partial\phi_i}{\partial t}\phi_j
 *      -T_i\frac{\partial k}{\partial x}\frac{\partial\phi_i}{\partial x}\phi_j
 *      +T_i k\frac{\partial\phi_i}{\partial x}\frac{\partial\phi_j}{\partial x}
 * \right\} dx
 * - \left[ k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right]_0^L = 0
 * \f]
 * Here, the first term is the rate of change of temperature at a single point
 * in the slab. The second term relates to the rate of deformation of the solid
 * and how that affects it's temperature. The third term accounts for the
 * extra derivative required due to the temperature dependence of thermal
 * diffusivity, and the final term in the integral is the \f$\nabla^2 T\f$ term.
